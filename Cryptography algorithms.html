      <li style="font-size:25px;"><b>Symmetric-key algorithms</b></li>
      <li style="font-size:20px;">Also referred to as a secret-key algorithm, a symmetric-key algorithm transforms data to make it extremely difficult to view without possessing a secret key.

The key is considered symmetric because it is used for both encrypting and decrypting. These keys are usually known by one or more authorized entities. Symmetric key algorithms are used for:</li>
<ul>
  <li style="font-size:20px;">Providing data confidentiality by using the same key for encrypting and decrypting data.</li>
  <li style="font-size:20px;">Providing Message Authentication Codes (MACs) for source and integrity authentication services. The key is used to create the MAC and then to validate it.</li>
  <li style="font-size:20px;">Establishing keys during key-establishment processes</li>
  <li style="font-size:20px;">Generating deterministic random numbers</li>
</ul>
      <li style="font-size:25px;"><b>Asymmetric-key algorithms</b></li>
      <li style="font-size:20px;">Also referred to as public-key algorithms, asymmetric-key algorithms use paired keys (a public and a private key) in performing their function. The public key is known to all, but the private key is controlled solely by the owner of that key pair. The private key cannot be mathematically calculated through the use of the public key even though they are cryptographically related. Asymmetric algorithms are used for:</li>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size:20px;">Computing digital signatures</li>
        <li style="font-size:20px;">Establishing cryptographic keying material</li>
        <li style="font-size:20px;">Identity Management</li>
      </ul>
