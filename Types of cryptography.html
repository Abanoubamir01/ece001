    <h1>Types of cryptography</h1>

    <ul>
      <li style="font-size:20px;">There are numerous cryptographic algorithms in use, but in general they can be broken into three categories: secret key cryptography, public key cryptography, and hash functions. Each has its own role to play within the cryptographic landscape.</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px;"><b>Secret key cryptography</b>. The Caesar cipher we discussed above is a great example of secret key cryptography. In the example we used, if encrypted messages were being exchanged between Caesar and one of his centurions, both parties would have to know the key — in this case, how many letters forward or backwards in the alphabet you need to move to transform plaintext to ciphertext or vice versa. But the key needs to stay a secret between the two of them. You couldn't send the key along with the message, for instance, because if both fell into enemy hands the message would be easy for them to decipher, defeating the whole purpose of encrypting it in the first place. Caesar and his centurion would presumably have to discuss the key when they saw each other in person, though obviously this is less than ideal when wars are being fought over long distances.

Secret key cryptography, sometimes also called symmetric key, is widely used to keep data confidential. It can be very useful for keeping a local hard drive private, for instance; since the same user is generally encrypting and decrypting the protected data, sharing the secret key is not an issue. Secret key cryptography can also be used to keep messages transmitted across the internet confidential; however, to successfully make this happen, you need to deploy our next form of cryptography in tandem with it.</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px;"><b>Public key cryptography</b>. Caesar may have been able to confer with his centurions in person, but you don't want to go into your bank and talk to the teller just to learn what the private key is for encrypting your electronic communication with the bank — that would defeat the purpose of online banking. In general, in order to function securely, the internet needs a way for communicating parties to establish a secure communications channel while only talking to each other across an inherently insecure network. The way this works is via public key cryptography.

In public key cryptography, sometimes also called asymmetric key, each participant has two keys. One is public, and is sent to anyone the party wishes to communicate with. That's the key used to encrypt messages. But the other key is private, shared with nobody, and it's necessary to decrypt those messages. To use a metaphor: think of the public key as opening a slot on a mailbox just wide enough to drop a letter in. You give those dimensions to anyone who you think might send you a letter. The private key is what you use to open the mailbox so you can get the letters out.

The mathematics of how you can use one key to encrypt a message and another to decrypt it are much less intuitive than the way the key to the Caesar cipher works.<a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/mathematical-algorithms-asymmetric-cryptography-introduction-public-key-infrastructure/" target="_blank"> The Infosec Institute has a deep dive if you're interested</a>. The core principle that makes the process work is that the two keys are actually related to each other mathematically such that it's easy to derive the public key from the private key but not vice versa. For instance, the private key might be two very large prime numbers, which you'd multiply together to get the public key.

The computations needed for public key cryptography are much more complex and resource intensive that those behind secret key infrastructure. Fortunately, you don't need to use it to protect every message you send online. Instead, what usually happens is that one party will use public key cryptography to encrypt a message containing yet another cryptographic key. This key, having been safely transmitted across the insecure internet, will then become the private key that encodes a much longer communications session encrypted via secret key encryption.

In this way, public key cryptography assists the cause of confidentiality. But these public keys are also part of a larger set of functions known as <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3400836/what-is-pki-and-how-it-secures-just-about-everything-online.html" target="_blank"> public key infrastructure</a>, or PKI. PKI provides ways to be sure that any given public key is associated with a specific person or institution. A message encrypted with a public key thus confirms the identity of the sender, establishing authentication and non-repudiation.</li>
      <li style="font-size:20px;"><b>Hash functions</b>. Public and private key cryptographic algorithms both involve transforming plaintext into ciphertext and then back into plaintext. By contrast, a hash function is one-way encryption algorithm: once you've encrypted your plaintext, you can't ever recover it from the resulting ciphertext (referred to as a hash).

This might make hash functions seem like a somewhat pointless exercise. But the key to their usefulness is that, for any given hash function, no two plaintexts will produce the same hash. (Mathematically, this isn't quite correct, but for any hash function actually in use, the chances of it happening are generally vanishingly small and can be safely ignored.)

This makes hashing algorithms a great tool for ensuring data integrity. For instance, a message can be sent along with its own hash. Upon receiving the message, you can run the same hashing algorithm on the message text; if the hash you produce is different from the one accompanying the message, you know the message has been modified in transit.

Hashing is also used to ensure the <a href="https://culttt.com/2013/01/21/why-do-you-need-to-salt-and-hash-passwords/" target="_blank"> confidentiality of passwords</a>. Storing passwords as plaintext is a big security no-no because that makes users prone to account and <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3575547/identity-theft-explained-why-businesses-make-tempting-targets.html" target="_blank">identity theft</a> in the wake of data breaches (which sadly doesn't stop <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3378019/facebook-stashing-plain-text-passwords-is-a-wake-up-call-to-improve-grc.html" target="_blank">big players from doing it</a> ). If instead you store a hashed version of a user's password, hackers won't be able to decrypt it and use it elsewhere even if they do manage to breach your defenses. When a legitimate user logs in with their password, you can just hash it and check against the hash you have on file.</li>
